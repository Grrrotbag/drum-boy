# Drum Boy

Drum boy was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp challenges.

It is a React app which plays either "retro" sounds or "synth" sounds depending on which setting is selected.

The buttons can be clicked, or the corresponding keyboard key can be pressed to play the sounds on the device.

Plus, the volume can be selected using the slider.

A working demo is deployed [here](https://drum-boy.netlify.app)
